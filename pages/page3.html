		<p> Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms . . . I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.
		<br></br> 
		 Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted.
 		<br></br> 
		Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible:the music.
		<br></br> 
		But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language
		<br></br>
		"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?" 
		<br></br>
		Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 
		<br></br>
		"The garden?" 
		<br></br>
		"The garden of forking paths."
		<br></br>
		Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 
		<br></br>
		"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."
		<br></br>
 		"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

	<p>  For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. 4 The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance. 
	<br></br>
	I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind.

	<p>   the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. </p>

	<p> a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon. </p>
